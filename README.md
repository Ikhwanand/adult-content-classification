# Adult Content Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on adult content classification using machine learning techniques. It aims to detect and classify adult content in images, which can be useful for content moderation and filtering purposes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the "AdultContents" collection, version 9, available on Roboflow Universe.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

adult-content-classification/ │ ├── data/ │ ├── train/ │ ├── valid/ │ └── README.dataset.txt │ └── README.md


- `data/`: Contains the dataset files
  - `train/`: Training data
  - `valid/`: Validation data
  - `README.dataset.txt`: Information about the dataset

## Data Format
The dataset uses XML files for annotation, which likely contain bounding box or polygon information for object detection or segmentation tasks related to adult content.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your Python environment
3. Install the required dependencies (to be specified)
4. Explore the dataset in the `data/` directory
5. Implement your classification model (to be added)

## Future Work
- Implement the classification model
- Add scripts for data preprocessing
- Create a training pipeline
- Develop evaluation metrics
- Add usage instructions for the trained model
